# iris4py
Python code for iris dataset for learning purposes

Here you can find a basic example about how to use sci-kit learn library in Python. The code uses basic data analysis 
techniques such as: decision tree, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, Random forest and Ada Boost, all of them trying
to classify the instances. In each case, the code shows the results in several ways: score, classification report, 
confusion matrix and learning curve.
